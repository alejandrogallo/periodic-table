# periodic-table
## Periodic Table of the Elements written in TeX / LaTeX


## 3 branches with different amounts of information

* Master branch has the most detailed information, including electronegativities, subshell information and weighted atomic masses with uncertainties.
* 121 branch has slightly less information about weighted atomic masses
* simpler branch omits electronegativity data, subshell information and simplifies atomic mass information.
