== 3 branches with different amounts of information

== Master branch has the most detailed information, including electronegativities, subshell information and weighted atomic masses with uncertainties.
== 121 branch has slightly less information about weighted atomic masses
== simpler branch omits electronegativity data, subshell information and simplifies atomic mass information.
